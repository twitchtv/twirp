Let's make the canonical Twirp example service: a `Haberdasher`.

The `Haberdasher` service makes hats. It has only one RPC method, `MakeHat`,
which makes a new hat of a particular size.

By the end of this, we'll run a Haberdasher server and have a client that can
send it requests.

There are 5 steps here:

 1. [Write a Protobuf service definition](#write-a-protobuf-service-definition)
 2. [Generate code](#generate-code)
 3. [Implement the server](#implement-the-server)
 4. [Mount and run the server](#mount-and-run-the-server)
 5. [Use the client](#use-the-client)

## Write a Protobuf Service Definition

Start with the [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
definition file, placed in `rpc/haberdasher/service.proto`:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package twirp.example.haberdasher;
option go_package = "haberdasher";

// Haberdasher service makes hats for clients.
service Haberdasher {
  // MakeHat produces a hat of mysterious, randomly-selected color!
  rpc MakeHat(Size) returns (Hat);
}

// Size of a Hat, in inches.
message Size {
  int32 inches = 1; // must be > 0
}

// A Hat is a piece of headwear made by a Haberdasher.
message Hat {
  int32 inches = 1;
  string color = 2; // anything but "invisible"
  string name = 3; // i.e. "bowler"
}
```

It's a good idea to add comments on your Protobuf file. These files can work as
the primary documentation of your API. They'll also show up in the generated Go
code, so they'll show up in Godoc.

## Generate code

To generate code run the `protoc` compiler pointed at your service's `.proto`
files:

```sh
$ protoc --proto_path=$GOPATH/src:. --twirp_out=. --go_out=. ./rpc/haberdasher/service.proto
```

The code is generated in the same directory as the `.proto` files.

You should see the generated files next to the `service.proto` file:

```text
/rpc
  /haberdasher
    service.pb.go     # auto-generated by protoc-gen-go (for protobuf serialization)
    service.proto     # original protobuf definition
    service.twirp.go  # auto-generated by protoc-gen-twirp (servers, clients and interfaces)
```

If you open the generated `.twirp.go` file, you will see a Go interface like
this:

```go
// A Haberdasher makes hats for clients.
type Haberdasher interface {
    // MakeHat produces a hat of mysterious, randomly-selected color!
    MakeHat(context.Context, *Size) (*Hat, error)
}
```

along with code to instantiate clients and servers.


## Implement the Server

Now, our job is to write code that fulfills the `Haberdasher` interface. This
will be the "backend" full of logic that we'll be serving.

For example, the implementation could go in
`internal/haberdasherserver/server.go`:

```go
package haberdasherserver

import (
    "context"
    "math/rand"

    "github.com/twitchtv/twirp"
    pb "github.com/twitchtv/twirpexample/rpc/haberdasher"
)

// Server implements the Haberdasher service
type Server struct {}

func (s *Server) MakeHat(ctx context.Context, size *pb.Size) (hat *pb.Hat, err error) {
    if size.Inches <= 0 {
        return nil, twirp.InvalidArgumentError("inches", "I can't make a hat that small!")
    }
    return &pb.Hat{
        Inches:  size.Inches,
        Color: []string{"white", "black", "brown", "red", "blue"}[rand.Intn(4)],
        Name:  []string{"bowler", "baseball cap", "top hat", "derby"}[rand.Intn(3)],
    }, nil
}
```

This meets the `Haberdasher` interface because it implements the `MakeHat` method, so we're ready to serve this over Twirp!

## Mount and run the server

To serve our Haberdasher over HTTP, use the auto-generated server constructor
`New{{Service}}Server`. For Haberdasher, this is:

```go
func NewHaberdasherServer(svc Haberdasher, hooks *twirp.ServerHooks) TwirpServer
```

This constructor wraps your interface implementation as an `TwirpServer`, which
is a `http.Handler` with a few extra bells and whistles.

It's easy to serve a `http.Handler` straight away with the standard library.
Just call `http.ListenAndServe`. For example, you might write the following in
`cmd/server/main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/twitchtv/twirpexample/internal/haberdasherserver"
    "github.com/twitchtv/twirpexample/rpc/haberdasher"
)

func main() {
  server := &haberdasherserver.Server{} // implements Haberdasher interface
  twirpHandler := haberdasher.NewHaberdasherServer(server, nil)

  http.ListenAndServe(":8080", twirpHandler)
}
```

If you `go run ./cmd/server/main.go`, you'll be running your server at
`localhost:8080`. All that's left is to create a client!

## Use the Client

Client stubs are automatically generated, hooray!

For each service, there are 2 client constructors:
 * `New{{Service}}ProtobufClient` for Protobuf requests.
 * `New{{Service}}JSONClient` for JSON requests.

The JSONClient is included as reference, to show that a Twirp server can handle
JSON requests, but you should really use ProtobufClient (see
[Protobuf vs JSON](protobuf_and_json.md)).

To use the `Haberdasher` service from another Go project, just import the
auto-generated client and then use it. You might do this, in `cmd/client/main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "net/http"
    "os"

    "github.com/twitchtv/twirpexample/rpc/haberdasher"
)

func main() {
    client := haberdasher.NewHaberdasherProtobufClient("http://localhost:8080", &http.Client{})

    hat, err := client.MakeHat(context.Background(), &haberdasher.Size{Inches: 12})
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("oh no: %v", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    fmt.Printf("I have a nice new hat: %+v", hat)
}
```

If you have the server running in another terminal, try running this client with
`go run ./cmd/client/main.go`. Enjoy the new hat!
