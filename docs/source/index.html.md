# Introduction

Twirp is Twitch's RPC system.

Define your service in a Profobuf file and then Twirp autogenerates Go code with a server interface and fully functional clients. It is similar to gRPC, but designed to integrate easily with Twitch infrastructure (i.e. it can run on HTTP 1.1, not just http/2).

Twirp handles routing and serialization for you in a well-tested, standardized, thoughtful way so you don't have to. Serialization and deserialization code is error-prone and tricky, and you shouldn't be wasting your time deciding whether it should be `POST /follows/:id/new` or `POST /:id/follows` or whatever. Just get to the real work of building services!

Along the way, you get an autogenerated client and a simple, smart framework for passing error messages. Nice!
